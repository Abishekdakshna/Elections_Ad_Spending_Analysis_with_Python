# Elections Ad Spending Analysis with Python

If you are highly active on Facebook and Instagram, you must have seen ads based on elections by any political party, especially BJP and INC. All the parties in India usually spend a lot of money on election campaigns. I recently collected data from Meta ads about how much money was spent on Instagram and Facebook ads by each political party during the 2024 Indian elections in each state. In this article, we perform elections ad spending analysis using Python and how it impacted the voting patterns.

## Elections Ad Spending Analysis: Dataset Overview
The dataset I have collected contains three files:
- **The Advertisers Dataset** provides insights into which pages (parties or organizations) spend money on election ads and the volume of ads they run.
- **The Locations Dataset** shows how much money was spent on ads in different locations, indicating where the campaigns were focusing their efforts.
- **The Results Dataset** provides actual voting data, showing how many people voted in each area and the percentage of voter turnout.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Visualization of ad spending trends
- Analysis of total electors, votes polled, and percentage trends
- Exporting insights and reports

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/election-ad-spending-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd election-ad-spending-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and analysis:
```sh
jupyter notebook "Elections Ad Spending Analysis with Python.ipynb"
```

## Notebook Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains:
- **10 Code Cells**: Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **9 Outputs**: Includes tables, charts, or printed results.
- **Data Analysis Steps**:
  - Load and clean the dataset.
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
  - Visualize ad spending trends using charts.
  - Summarize key findings.

## Conclusion
Overall, the analyses indicate that higher ad spend does not guarantee higher voter turnout and that various other factors influence voter engagement. Larger and more significant states tend to spend more on ads, but this does not necessarily translate to higher voter participation. Political parties, particularly the BJP, invest heavily in advertising, yet the effectiveness of this spending in increasing voter turnout is questionable.
